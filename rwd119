http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/the-principles-of-adaptive-design/

You May Be Losing Users If Responsive Web Design Is Your Only Mobile Strategy
http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/07/22/responsive-web-design-should-not-be-your-only-mobile-strategy/
It's good to see more people in the community trying to move beyond the original concepts of responsive design and focus more upon what is best for the user (performance being one of those things). As with most articles you should take them with a grain of salt, for instance I disagree with the suggestion of replacing media queries with JS matchMedia to load in the CSS required and there seems to be a poor out of context use of a quote. Still, the basic concept of the article to look beyond RWD and find ways to make the web faster is absolutely what we should be aiming for.

A Look At The Current Responsive Design Landscape (And How To Speed It Up)
http://sideproject.io/a-look-at-the-current-responsive-design-landscape/
This article looks at a few recently launched responsive sites and how well they perform. It's not necessarily about the final page load time, but the perceived load time and the time it takes for your users to begin consuming content or engaging with your site.

Responsive Logos
http://responsivelogos.co.uk/
Joe Harrison has taken a look at how logos from some of the well known brands might respond across a variety of viewports. A great experiment but I think a better answer lies with creating a design system as they did for the Whitney Museum logo (http://whitney.org/NewIdentity),
