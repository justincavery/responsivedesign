Hello and welcome to another week of responsification... yes it's real word*

This week our feature site is our much loved hosting provider for the responsive design weekly website, MediaTemple. This week I created a (quick overview)[rwd.is/example/mediatemple] of the responsive nature of their site and I'll be speaking with some of the front end crew about their approach and some of their decisions behind the build.

We recently took a step closer towards a responsive image solution after the <picture> approach was nearly cast aside before making an almighty comeback to lead the race.

There's also a new workshop doing the rounds featuring a couple of people that know a thing or two about content and responsive design, but more about that later.

Lets get to those links.

*not really a real word



Bug 19619 – Remove media="" from <source> if it isn't used 
https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=19619#c31
This has been backed up with this comment showing that <picture> is on the Mozilla's DOM team's roadmap for Q1 2014.

http://typecast.com/blog/a-more-modern-scale-for-web-typography
Maintaining a good typographic scale across many viewports can be difficult. Thankfully someone has done all the hardwork for us and created these set of new rules for a responsive approach (and someone even sassified them up too (https://gist.github.com/hatefulcrawdad/8463591)

Bulletproof Accessible Icon Fonts 
http://filamentgroup.com/lab/bulletproof_icon_fonts/
Icons can be a great way to convey meaning across smaller viewports. If your using icon fonts for social icons, three lines for menus, magnifying glass for search etc then you should understand the possible issues and solutions that come along with their use.

A Client-side Responsive Image Solution, Finally 
https://medium.com/cool-code-pal/d9a47f94eea7
I toyed with this idea in a huge twitter conversation a few months back. The consensus of the discussion was more that we were asking too much input from the user. This is a great solution for now, but we need to get browsers to allow these preferences to be set within the browsers so every site can benefit from these hints.

# TIP OF THE WEEK: Organising your sass

Are you one of those people that love your CSS and take pride in crafting a CSS document?  If so the chances are that you also haven't taken the leap into CSS preprocessors because of this exact reason.  My colleague Chris was one of those people until recently and is currently finding the delight that comes with scss over css.  My one tip for him when he got started was to break up his Sass files into modules by creating _module.scss files, and to use a breakpoint mixin to write the media query changes to the module inline with the rest of the rules.  

Chris is now much happier with life. If you want a little more direction on this then you're in luck, I've elaborated a little more here.
