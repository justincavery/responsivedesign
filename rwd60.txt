
Today we feature some great articles.  One of them is about taking responsive design the next step and providing contextual/responsive information to the user, for example based on the time of day. People are quick to dismiss this because we don't have a full grasp as to what that particular user is doing at that particular time, so how dare we try and guess and provide content around that scenario.  The fact is, our whole website is one big content guess about what the user is looking for and trying to achieve.  

The thing that we need to look out for is keeping our content consistent for returning users, because on returning at another time of day I will expect to find the same information that was there in the morning. If it's gone then a sensible user journey needs to be available for the user to find that content again.  Food for though though.

Structuring And Serving Styles For Older Browsers
http://seesparkbox.com/foundry/structuring_and_serving_styles_for_older_browsers
You’re probably aware that not all browsers support media queries. IE8 and below (plus a few other older browsers) simply can’t see styles that are cloaked in media queries. If we build a responsive site from small size up, these browsers will download all of our styles, but they will only be able to comprehend the stuff outside of media queries. If your project calls for a good experience in these browsers (many projects nowadays still do), this won’t work. You’re going to need a way to serve up these styles in a way that these elderly browsers can digest. The team at See Spark Box put their heads together to come up with a solution.

Even at the possible expense of wasted bandwidth and low definition — heck, even up-scaling — this introduces less complexity and concern than any “responsive/adaptive image” technique seen to-date. They’re all hacks. They all break things.
